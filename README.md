# Sequence to Sequence models

Sequence to sequence models implemented using pytorch.

# Models

The models were implemented based on the papers:

- [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks:](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) Encoder-Decoder architecure which uses multi-layer LSTMs. <a href="/seq2seq_models/seq2seq_LSTM/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-%23EE4C2C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white" width="50"></a>
